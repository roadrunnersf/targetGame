The game is deployed to Netlify and can be played [here](https://target-game.netlify.com)

This is one of my first Javascript projects and was created in late 2018.

The player’s objective is to shoot rapidly shrinking targets as they appear on the screen. The player has the opportunity to progress through various ‘levels’ as they become more skilled. I created the game using object-oriented programming principles and event-driven programming.

To run the game locally, just clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser of choice.
